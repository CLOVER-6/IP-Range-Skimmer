# IP-Range-Skimmer
A simple script to skim an IP range. Not as effective as NMAP or such, but extremely lightweight and provides simple output.

## Usage
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
> python3 ipskim.py <subnet mask (i.e. 192.168.0.0/24)> <file to store output>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Notes

This will recieve not as much maintenance compared to my other projects, simply due to it being a shorter more lightweight script
